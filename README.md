# kRPC control systems

Uses the kRPC mod for Kerbal Space Program to control rockets and spacecraft.  
Requires [the latest release of kRPC](https://github.com/nullprofile/krpc/releases/tag/0.4.9-1.12.1)

## File structure
- `lib`: Contains a header-only custom library for kRPC. This is where most of the calculations are done.
- `missions`: Each folder in this directory corresponds to a certain mission that I've done in the game. Each mission has its own craftfile that contains the spacecraft used for the mission.
